
MobilityNebula
===============

An open-source geospatial trajectory data streaming platform based on [NebulaStream](https://nebula.stream/).

MobilityNebula explores the advantages of [MobilityDB](https://github.com/MobilityDB/MobilityDB) datatypes and functions in the NebulaStream environment, using the [MEOS](https://libmeos.org/) library as middleware.

The MobilityDB project is developed by the Computer & Decision Engineering Department of the [Université libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/) (ULB) under the direction of [Prof. Esteban Zimányi](http://cs.ulb.ac.be/members/esteban/). ULB is an OGC Associate Member and member of the OGC Moving Feature Standard Working Group ([MF-SWG](https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/movfeatswg)).

----
NebulaStream is our TU Berlin/ BIFOLD attempt to develop a general-purpose, end-to-end data management system for the IoT.
It provides an out-of-the-box experience with rich data processing functionalities and a high ease-of-use.

NebulaStream is a joint research project between the DIMA group at TU Berlin and BIFOLD.

Learn more about Nebula Stream at https://www.nebula.stream or take a look at our [documentation](docs).

# Clang-Format, Clang-Tidy, License & Pragma Once Check, and Ensure Correct Comments
We use `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` to ensure code quality and consistency.
To run the checks, you can use the target `format`. 

## Project Structure
Check the [Project Structure](docs/project_structure.md) to understand the dependency between components. 

## Development
NebulaStream targets C++23 using all features implemented in both `libc++` 18 and `libstdc++` 13.2. All tests are using
`Clang` 18.
Follow the [development guide](docs/technical/development.md) to learn how to set up the development environment.
To see our code of conduct, please refer to [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Build Types
This project supports multiple build types to cater to different stages of development and deployment. Below are the details of each build type:

### Debug
- **Default Logging Level**: All logging messages are compiled.
- **Assert Checks**: Enabled.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for development, providing comprehensive logging and assert checks to help identify and fix issues.

### RelWithDebInfo (Release with Debug Information)
- **Default Logging Level**: Warning.
- **Assert Checks**: Enabled.
- **Use Case**: Balances performance and debugging, including warning-level logging and assert checks for useful debugging information without full logging overhead.

### Release
- **Default Logging Level**: Error.
- **Assert Checks**: Enabled.
- **Use Case**: Optimized for performance, with logging set to error level and assert checks disabled, ensuring only critical issues are logged.

### Benchmark
- **Logging Level**: None.
- **Assert Checks**: Disabled.
- **Use Case**: Designed for maximum performance, omitting all logging and assert checks, including null pointer checks. Suitable for thoroughly tested environments where performance is critical.
- Use this with care, as this is not regularly tested, i.e., Release terminates deterministically if a bug occurs (failed invariant/precondition), whereas Benchmark will be in an undefined state.
